                            books with text and audio. The current version does not play audio-only DAISY books; support

                        <p>You will need to have <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash Player</a> installed

                        <p><product-name xmlns=''/> uses your computer's "text to speech" (TTS) capabilities to read DAISY books.
                            Windows XP (SP2), Windows Vista, and Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) all have built-in speech
                            synthesis. On a Linux computer you will need to install espeak.</p>

                        <p>To test your TTS setup, open the "Voice Settings" dialog (Open the Tools menu, select
                            <product-name xmlns=''/>, select Settings, and choose Voice Settings) and then press the "Test Voice"
                            button. If you hear your computer speaking, then the TTS is working properly. Please
                            <a href="http://www.bookshare.org/contactUs">contact us</a>

                    <h2 id="reading_a_book" >Reading A Book</h2>

                    <p>If you prefer to let your screenreader do the talking, press Alt Shift F3 (to jump to the content
                        of the book). You will now be able to navigate the book as if it was a web page.</p>

                    <p>To have <product-name xmlns=''/> speak the book, press the play button (or press Alt Shift F3 to jump to the book's
                        content, and press 'p' to start playback. It will begin reading from the top of the book. If you
                        press 'p' or escape while the book is being read, <product-name xmlns=''/> will pause. Pressing 'p' again after
                        that will resume from the same paragraph.</p>

		  <h2 id="narration_modes">Narration Modes</h2>
		  
		  <p><product-name xmlns=''/> has three Narration Modes, which control what it will read to you. These can be
		  chosen using keyboard shortcuts, or from the "Audio Settings" dialog. These are as follows:</p>
		  
		  <level3>
		      <a name="comprehensive_narration"/>
		      <h3>Comprehensive Narration</h3>
		      <p>In this mode, <product-name xmlns=''/> will read Firefox menus, Firefox tab names, the settings dialogs,
		      as well as everything needed to navigate and read a book. This mode is great for reading on computers
		      without a separate screenreader installed, or if you prefer to pause your screenreader when you 
		      start up Firefox. You'll need to turn your screenreader back on if you wish to read web pages within
		      Firefox, as <product-name xmlns=''/> does not yet provide that ability. To enable this mode, press <em>Alt Shift
		      F10</em>.</p>
		  </level3>
		  <level3>
		      <a name="book_nav_narration"/>
		      <h3>Book and Navigation Narration</h3>
		      <p>In this mode, <product-name xmlns=''/> will narrate only the book and the navigation controls for the book. To
		      hear anything else in Firefox, you will need to re-enable your screenreader. This mode allows you to
		      use <product-name xmlns=''/>'s navigation key shortcuts, and to interact with the DAISY book at a more detailed level
		      than your screenreader probably supports. To enable this mode, press <em>Alt Shift F11</em>.</p>
		  </level3>
		  <level3>
		      <a name="mute_narration"/>
		      <h3>Mute</h3>
		      <p><product-name xmlns=''/> can be completely silent if you prefer. This allows you to let your screenreader do the 
		      talking, or to read books without narration. To mute <product-name xmlns=''/>'s narration, press <em>Alt Shift F12</em>.

		    <h2 id="navigating_with_the_keyboard">Navigating <product-name xmlns=''/>'s Interface With The Keyboard</h2>
                    
		    <p>There are three areas in the <product-name xmlns=''/> user interface: the table of contents (which is rendered as a sidebar),
                    the navigation bar (which contains a control which allows you to skip to pages, and a notes menu),
                    and the main book contents (which can be read by your screenreader like any regular web page, in Firefox.) 
                    It's important to understand that <product-name xmlns=''/> is an extension within Firefox itself, and as such there are
                    many core Firefox features that are outside of the scope of this manual. DAISY books are loaded as 
                    individual tabs in Firefox; you can switch between tabs using the <em>Ctrl tab</em> key.                                                           
                    </p>
                    
		    <p>If you are using your screenreader to read the contents of the book, these are the only controls you
                    need to learn. If you will be using <product-name xmlns=''/>'s built in voicing, then you will want to read the 
                    <a href="#keyboard_navigation">section describing navigation of a book</a> after this one.</p>
                    <level3>
                        <h3>The Table of Contents</h3>
                        <p>The Table of Contents of the book or document is rendered as a tree in Firefox's sidebar. To move
                        the focus to the Table of Contents, press <em>Alt Shift F1</em>. You will now be able to use the arrow keys 
			to move through the contents; pressing enter on any heading will set the focus to the book's contents at
                        that particular location.</p>                   
                    </level3>
                    <level3>
                        <h3>The Navigation Bar</h3>
                        <p>The Navigation Bar is an overlay at the top of the book's contents. It contains three controls:
                        paging, notes, and playback buttons. You can press <em>Alt Shift F2</em> to jump to the navigation
			bar, and then tab between the elements. Managing notes, and changing pages will be described in more 
			detail later in this guide.</p>
                        <level4>
                            <h4>Playback Controls</h4>
                            <p>On the right of the navigation bar are visual playback controls. You can tab to these and
                            press space to select them, but there are keyboard shortcuts for control of playback which 
                            you will find it more convenient to use. The following section will describe these in more
                            depth.</p>                        
                        </level4>
                    </level3>
		    <level3>
		      <h3>The Book Contents</h3>
		      <p>To jump to the book's contents, you can press <em>Alt Shift F3</em>. Many of <product-name xmlns=''/>'s navigation
		      keys depend on you being focused on the book's contents directly.</p>

                    <h2 id="keyboard_navigation" >Navigating A Book With Your Keyboard</h2>

                    <p><product-name xmlns=''/> has keyboard shortcuts which give you control over the playback of a book.</p>

                    <level3>
                        <h3>Next and Previous</h3>
                        <p>You can skip between elements (e.g. paragraphs) in the book using the next (<em>ctrl /</em>) and
                            previous (<em>ctrl ,</em>) keys. If you use these keys while <product-name xmlns=''/> is reading, it will pause
                            after reading the element that you navigated to. You can then press 'p' again to resume
                            playback, or press next or previous again. You can also use the <em>ctrl .</em> key to reread the 
			    element at the current position.</p>
                    </level3>

                    <level3>
                        <h3>Lists</h3>

                        <p>When a list is read, <product-name xmlns=''/> will first announce "list", and then will speak each of the
                            list items in turn. If the list is nested, the level is spoken before the list items are
                            read. <product-name xmlns=''/> will announce "list complete".</p>

                        <p>For example, try the following list with playback or keyboard navigation.</p>

                        <list type="ul">
                            <li>A</li>
                            <li>
                                <p>B</p>
                                <list type="ol">
                                    <li>First</li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Middle</p>
                                        <list type="ol">
                                            <li>apple</li>
                                            <li>orange</li>
                                            <li>peach</li>
                                        </list>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Last</li>
                                </list>
                            </li>

                        <h3>Sidebars</h3>
                        <p>A sidebar is presented as a box with text or images inside it. <product-name xmlns=''/> will announce
                            "sidebar" when it encounters one during narration, and then continue to read the contents of
                            it. Following is an example.</p>

                        <sidebar>
                            <hd>Example</hd>

                            <p>Sidebars are related content. Often you'll see them contain extra information like
                                diagrams, related articles, or biographies.</p>
                        </sidebar>

                        <p>Content often continues "after" a sidebar.</p>
                    </level3>

                    <level3>
		    <pagenum>6</pagenum>
                        <h3>Tables</h3>

                        <p>When you encounter a table in during playback, <product-name xmlns=''/> automatically pauses. Within a table
                            you can use the table navigation keystrokes (<em>ctrl with arrow keys</em>) to move around the table;
                            if you hit one of the table edges, you will hear a system bell. The keyboard shortcut 
			    <em>ctrl .</em> will read the cell that you are currently on, if you'd like to hear it again.
			    If you wish to have the table read to you cell by cell, just press play, and <product-name xmlns=''/> will 
			    resume reading. If you wish to skip the table completely, you can press <em>escape</em>.</p>

                        <p>Try the keyboard navigation or playback on the following simple table.</p>

                        <table>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Team</th>
                                <th>Location</th>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                <td>San Francisco Giants</td>
                                <td>AT&amp;T Park</td>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                <td>Oakland Athletics</td>
                                <td>Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum</td>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                <td>Los Angeles Dodgers</td>
                                <td>Dodger Stadium</td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>

                        <p>When a table has cells with more complicated content, the cell is announced to have "multiple
                            items" and you can navigate the cell's content. For example, here are the same teams with
                            more details:</p>

                        <table>

                                <th>Information</th>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                <td>San Francisco Giants</td>

		    <h2>How to Use Notes</h2>
		    <p><product-name xmlns=''/> allows you to take notes as you are reading. Notes are displayed inside a box 
		    with an icon to differentiate them from the main text in the book. When <product-name xmlns=''/> is narrating
		    the book to you, a note will be announced as "Note", and then read to you.</p>
		    
		    <p>To create a note, either choose "Add Note" from the "My Notes" menu on the action bar, 
		    click the (+) icon on the action bar, or press <em>ctrl i</em>. You will be asked to enter a name
		    for a note, and then the note itself. <product-name xmlns=''/> will automatically generate a name based on the note's
		    location within the book, but you don't	need to use its suggestion.</p>
		    
		    <p>Once a note is created, it will appear in three places: the book text, the table of contents, 
		    and the "My Notes" menu. Choosing a note from the "My Notes" menu or the table of contents will 
		    navigate directly to the note within the book. If you want to delete or change a note, you can do 
		    so by choosing the "Manage Notes" option from the "My Notes" menu.</p>
		    
		    <p>You can quickly skip between notes in a book using the keyboard; <em>ctrl alt [</em> and 
		    <em>ctrl alt ]</em> will step between the previous and next notes.</p>
                </level2>

		<level2>
		  <h2>Changing Page</h2>
		  <p>You probably noticed that this user guide has page numbers. As you navigate the book, the
		  action bar will change to show you which page you are currently on. To navigate back and forwards by page,
		  use the keyboard shortcuts <em>alt ctrl ;</em> and <em>alt ctrl '</em>. Alternatively, you can 
		  jump to the navigation bar (<em>alt shift F2</em>), and tab once to hear the current page. If you type
		  a new page number and press enter, <product-name xmlns=''/> will jump to the new page.</p>			  
		</level2>
		<pagenum>8</pagenum>
		
		<level2>
		  <h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
		  <p><product-name xmlns=''/> has three settings dialogs, all of which can be invoked from the Tools / <product-name xmlns=''/> / Settings
		  menu.</p>
		  
		  <level3>
		    <h3 id="voice_settings">Voice Settings</h3>
		    <p>This allows you to choose the speech rate and length of pause.</p>
		    
		    <p><strong>Speech Rate</strong> changes the speed of <product-name xmlns=''/>'s narration. You can also control the 
		    speech rate via keyboard shortcuts, using <em>alt pageup</em> to increase and <em>alt pagedown</em> to
		    decrease the speed of the voice.</p>
		    
		    <p>Use the Preview button to hear how the new settings sound. If you're satisfied, press Save. If you
		    want to revert to how they were, press Cancel to close the dialog without saving.</p>
		    
		    <p><product-name xmlns=''/> currently will use the default voice on your computer. In Windows, this can be changed
		    from the SAPI settings screen in the control panel. In OSX, changing the VoiceOver settings will change
		    the voice used. Under Linux, you cannot currently change ESpeak's default voice. Future versions of 
		    <product-name xmlns=''/> will offer more control of which voice is used on all platforms.</p>		    
		  </level3>
		  
		  <level3>
		    <h3 id="audio_settings">Audio Settings</h3>
		    <p>This allows you to control <product-name xmlns=''/>'s audio prompts.</p>
		    <p><strong>Voicing Mode</strong> allows you to choose which <a href="#narration_modes">Narration Mode</a> to use.</p>
		    <p>When <strong>Play Sound When <product-name xmlns=''/> Launches</strong> is enabled, <product-name xmlns=''/> will play an audio tone
		    when it first launches.</p>
		    <p>When <strong>Play Sound When Moving Between Navigation Areas</strong> is enabled, <product-name xmlns=''/> will play
		    different audio tones when you toggle between the Table of Contents, Navigation Bar, and Book.</p>
		  </level3>
		  
		  <level3> 
		    <h3 id="advanced_settings">Advanced Settings</h3>
		    <p>These settings allow you to control aspects of how <product-name xmlns=''/> displays books.</p>
		    
		    <p>When <strong>Show Images When Displaying Books</strong> is enabled, images will be loaded as you
		    navigate through the book. If necessary, you can speed up the loading and overall navigation of books by turning 
		    this feature off.</p>
		    <p><strong>Use Prerecorded Narration When Available</strong> allows you to use human narration if supplied with
		    the DAISY book. If you turn this option off, <product-name xmlns=''/> will use your Narration Mode settings to determine
		    whether or not to use text to speech.</p>
		    <p><strong>Enable Quirks Mode</strong> is a setting for content producers. If you turn this option off,
		    <product-name xmlns=''/> will only load strictly correct DAISY content. In future versions, this setting will be expanded
		    to do more validation; currently, it toggles strict validation of certain namespaces.</p>
